This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


Well before starting, it is a challenge to be able to make the functionalities work the way they should. The application is made using the following technologies:

Next. JS 14 ['NextJS Doc'](https://nextjs.org/docs)

MongoDB ['MongoDB Doc'](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/)

ChadCN ['ChadCN Doc'](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

Tailwind CSS ['Tailwind Docs'](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss)

Clerk ['Clerk Docs'](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)

Zod ['Zod Doc'](https://zod.dev/)

Vercel ['Vercel'](https://vercel.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
